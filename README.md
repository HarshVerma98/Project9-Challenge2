# Project9-Challenge2
Hacking With Swift Solution

Challenges
Modify project 8 so that loading and parsing a level takes place in the background. Once youâ€™re done, make sure you update the UI on the main thread!



This project is based on Paul Hudson (Twitter @twostraws) Hacking with Swift Project 9 Challenge2. It contains my solutions to his challenges during Day 40 of the 100 Days of Swift initiative (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/40).
